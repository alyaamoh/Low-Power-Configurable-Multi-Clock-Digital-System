# RST Synchronizer
Asynchronous reset has many issues during de-assertion as it may violate the recovery and removal times of the Flip Flop, so Reset Synchronizer in digital circuit is needed to synchronize the de-assertion of the asynchronous reset with respect to the clock domain. In other words, a reset synchronizer manipulates the asynchronous reset to have synchronous de-assertion.
