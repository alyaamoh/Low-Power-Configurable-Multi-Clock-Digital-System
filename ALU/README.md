# ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
ALU_TOP is the fundamental building block of the processor, which is responsible for carrying out different functions:
### 1. Arithmetic functions through ARITHMETIC_UNIT block.
### 2. Logic functions through LOGIC_UNIT block.
### 3. Shift functions through SHIFT _UNIT block. 
### 4. Comparison functions through CMP_UNIT block. 
And Decoder Unit responsibles for enable which Function to operate according to the highest Most significant 2-bit of the ALU_FUNC control bus ALU_FUNC [3:2]
